# Week 5 HomeWork- matching

This week has been pretty crazy for me, my computer broke, and my personal life has been a little crazy. But I was able to progress through the lectures and got through the assignment pretty well. Although I did spend almost 2 hours debugging issues

 I tried a couple different methods of making this game, but I couldnt find a way that worked as well as the hw-example. As I examined that code, I learned alot about what is actually going on. In the lecture, it all seemed so easy but once you start needing to do more complex things, it definitely got more confusing.

 Either way I did manage to get through this assignment and am looking forward to finishing it next week. One issue ive run into though , is how to center my grid. Currently they are all leaning towards the left side of the page. All the info I found just didnt quite make sense to me.
