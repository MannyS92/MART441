# Week 6 HomeWork- matching

Wow!! This was the very hardest coding assignment Ive done yet. I couldnt really find any ways to achieve what I wanted through google, so I had to really think about the issues I was having and solve them on my own. Now Im sure , I didnt do everything in the most efficient way possible, but Im still proud that I was able to come up with a solution that worked for me. I do wish I had chosen easier images because after solving this puzzle a thousand times, I really feel like Im going crazy. I felt so excited when I realized Arrays were how I could keep track of how many moves I had made. That was a moment when it all kind of clicked. I still struggled for quite  awhile after that. But I am still proud of the game I had made.
