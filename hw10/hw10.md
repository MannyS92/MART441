#Homework10

This assignment was ok, I found myself having a few different issues I cant quite solve. First is that my paddle only changes shape once, no matter how many times its hit and I dont know why. Also the arrow buttons are also controlling the audio and I cant find out why. Other than that Im start to get ahold of using the canvas but definitely need more practice.
