#HW-2

For this HW assignment, my inspiration was cheesy websites from the 90s. In particular, the websites for some text based adventures and nerdy dungeons and dragons websites. I have memories of tacky music autoplaying and clip art of dragons and torches.

Unfortunately, Chrome disabled the ability to autoplay music. There are some work arounds that I tried, but none of them worked. I possibly could have discovered how, but it wasn't worth the time it was taking.

There is some more stuff Id like to add to this website like maybe some torches and some small tweaks to the design to make my "Bad 90s Web Design" more obvious. In the future Id like to insert an actual text-based adventure game into this page. I think that would be fun for potential clients or employers to see my inspirations and what I'm capable of.

Another thing I would like to add would be one of those counters that shows how many people have visited the webpage.

As far as javascript goes, alot of it is starting to come back to me from when I took creative coding, but I still have so much I need to practice with it.

Overall, this assignment was easier than last weeks, as I was able to just build on from what I had already done last week. But I find in order to really bring my idea into fruition, there is still a lot I want to do.




Edit: After going to my website from github, the music is autoplaying, So I am not too sure what is going on with it.I went ahead and left the music player on the page so that the music will work in some other browsers.
