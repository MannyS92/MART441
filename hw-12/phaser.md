#HW-12

This home was a little difficult but not too hard. Life was a little hectic this week between classes and tornados.The semester is winding down and everything feels like a struggle but Im excited about my final project and am continuing to press on through everything. I can see the power that is possible through phaser and can definitely see why it is so popular.
