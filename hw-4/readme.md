#HW 4

This assignment provided a lot of struggle, but I finally feel like I understand whats going on as far as progressing through choices and decisions.

Ive been trying to do free code camp along side this class just to help reinforce what im learning. But one area Im still feeling a little confused on is how to implement these loops to a project. Im doing more research to help me understand these topics.

This week was tough but I know the areas Id like to improve on before the net assignment and will be focusing on those areas to prepare.
