# HW Assignment 1

Overall, I must say that this week was so much fun but also extremely tough and very time consuming. I have spent every day working on this assignment and it involved a lot of research on my part. The first issue I ran into was my desktop having issues and having use my Chromebook.

I am fortunate that my Chromebook has a Linux-Development option and I was able to download git and Atom on it. My Chromebook cant download github desktop on it, but this did make me very comfortable using git through command line to push changes to github. I also found a git package for Atom that has allowed me to stage and push changes to github.

The last coding class I took was in the Spring of 2018 as Ive had issues with financial aid and personal issues. So this assignment was very daunting. I had no idea where to begin. After doing some research on other websites I liked, I decided just to start from the very basics and to just keep adding more and more until the page resembled my inspiration page.

I had to look up almost everything, but I am still surprised by just how much I remembered. Everything came out almost exactly how I wanted. But there are two things I know  I need to improve on as we move forward. One is web responsiveness and the other is the organization of nested elements how I chose what to nest.

The web responsiveness was especially confusing. I just dont feel very sure at all about what to change as far as images and text, and what to change their size to, and at what size screen to change these things. This area , I know I need to spend much more time playing around with. Overall, I am very pleased with my site I made and am looking forward to improving week to week.
