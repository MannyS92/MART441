#Week 13

This week  was pretty difficult, mainly because of outside stressors from how my work is adjusting to Coronavirus and it has left me pretty exhausted with all of the work and everything. So I definitely just feel like I ran out of time and energy when it came to this project.

I tried to follow along with your example but I still just struggled to get a second array of shapes on the canvas. The idea was to make it kind of a space fighter game but Im just really struggling this week. But Im confident Ill be able to regroup and try to finish stronger and complete the next assignment more fully.
