#HW-8

I have had a lot of trouble with this weeks assignment, Ive been battling the flue for the past couple days and I feel like I just need more time studying and need to spend time doing easier assignments to work my way up with where we are now. Basically I just need to spend more time with it. Im having trouble just fully understanding whats going on. I feel like I understand basically whats going on but I just dont fully understand how to do what I want. I havent had as much time to study this week and I know Ill need to study more as this course goes on.

I watched your hw example but I was feeling really lost in how the Arrays were being called and how that was all working. I found another example of how someone was using arrays,jquery and fadein/out https://jsbin.com/cuyiqice/1/edit?html,js,output, his example felt more readable to me because I was having a particular hard time this week. So I used his as a starting point to launch off from. I know I needed to turn something in and I didnt want to struggle and turn in nothing
