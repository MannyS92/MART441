I was having alot of trouble getting my images to show and tried for a very long time to get it but after getting your email, I realized how to fix my mistake. I am much happier with it now but I still need help with 2 issues. I am unhappy with how much space is above my btnSubmit. I have tried adjusting the padding and margin for both it and the title but it still stays in the same place. I then tried a few different display methods but I just cant get it.

Also my image number 4 goes outside my image viewfinder background that I put in. How would you approach this so that it fits in ?

Either way, Im mostly happy with this project and am looking forward to the next.
