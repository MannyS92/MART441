#hw-7

I am feeling completely frustrated. I have been trying to figure out for 5 hours how to display my images and I just cant do it. I have tried almost everything I can think of but nothing seems to work and I just cant figure it out. Its my fault for starting to get into the "meat" of this assignment until today but I still just cant figure it out and I honestly cant look at this issue anymore. I did my best to make the rest of the viewfinder as I imagined it but I can longer put effort into making the images appear without going crazy.
